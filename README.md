# 2D_array_search

A simple Swift project demonstrating a 2D array search, with a focus on visualization rather than performance.

## Getting Started

1.  Run the app.
2.  Rotate the simulator (CMD + Left).
3.  Re-run the app.

## System Requirements

Optimized for iPad 10th generation.


## Visualization

![Animated sequence of a search on a grid of 10 by 10. Each cell in the grid represents one letter at random. We are interested in finding a sequnce of 4 characters that represent the word RAFA](https://github.com/AmirJahan/2D_array_search/blob/main/2D_Array_Search.gif)

## How to Use

*   **Grid Size:** Adjust the grid dimensions in `AppData.swift`.
*   **Search Word:** Modify the search word in `AppData.swift`.
    *   **Note:** The search word must be exactly 4 characters long due to visualization limitations.
*   **Manual Sequence Insertion:** Use the `ViewModel.swift` to manually insert sequences of interest.
